Bajonear is a salvadorean-spanish verb that you use to refer
                    to the action of eating after hours, probably after a party or
                    a long day at work.
                    You can use it when you are famished and heading towards to
                    grab a bite, something like *I am going to bajonear*.

I am Bajoneando because I code for a living but after dark I code for fun in Scala/Clojure/Haskell while I'm
*Bajoneando* with a cup of joe, nuts or dried fruit.

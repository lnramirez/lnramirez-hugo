* Edit option, now I can come back anytime and update content of an entry
* We are using markdown for formatting, it's simple and fun. 
* Sorting on date

Next iteration will be: Guaymango

Hopefully it'll bring lots of new stuff and also quicker, trying to keep it on a two week iteration, instead of a for week iteration.

+++
Bajonear is a salvadorean-spanish verb that you use to refer to the action of eating after hours, probably after a party or a long day at work. You can use it when you are famished and heading towards to grab a bite, something like I am going to bajonear.

I am Bajoneando as you can see in the footer because I usually program at work only but nowadays I have been feeling like programming after hours with a cup of joe, nuts, dried fruit or any paleo snack that I can eat.

I was not planning deploying SNAPSHOTS but I was adding security functionality and felt so tempted to deploy it and I am so happy I did.

Although the only new feauture is login/logout functionality and securing edit and add blog entries I think it was worthy doing it, and since at least as of today deploying new version doesn't mean spend more money, why not? 

Hopefully I will have done few thing here and there by the end of the week and recap Huizúcar iteration. Until then.

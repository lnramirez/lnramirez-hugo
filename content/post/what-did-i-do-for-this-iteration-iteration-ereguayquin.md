I did very few things actually. I finally publish my personal website. It's crazy that I've been programming for the last 10 year and never own a site. Crazy huh? 

Well, actually I was never interested in doing so, why would I program after hours? how would I pay for that? I hate it so much the other hosting available, they were all restrictive php on it's best and I couldn't show off all the amazing stuff I do for a living! 

Then one day I finally come across cloudfoundry.com, a hosting PaaS that provides spring functionality, databases like postgres, mysql and also a NoSQL service, MongoDB which I only knew was one of the nice things to know nowadays. 

After a couple of months working every now and then, procrastinating, and taking it lightly, last week I finally came up with the idea that I should build my own site, show off what I can do, technologies I use every day and having one place to keep track of my stuff. Why not use a social network site or whatever is available out there? well, I've tried that before and never worked out. Now I have my own site, the way I like it and I can tweak it to my wishes so be it!

What did I publish today?

* Home and about screen
* The most basic blog capture and display which you (is anyone out there?) are seeing right now

As of today I am only capturing data and showing directly, my previous post doesn't even have carriage return (OMG) but I can live with that. I can always come back and fix my data, formatting and so on. 

If you come across this site you'll be able to post a blog, I don't think anyone will do, but if you do, only be nice :) 

I name my releases after a municipality of my home country. I had 5 releases 4 of which never saw the light but the 5th was the one. 

* Acajutla
* Bolivar
* Cinquera
* Dulce Nombre De Marí­a
* Ereguayquin

This release is under the name Ereguayquin a municipality of department Usulután in my native El Salvador. Of Lenca origin that means Village of Hawks. 

Next itereation will be under the name: Las Flores

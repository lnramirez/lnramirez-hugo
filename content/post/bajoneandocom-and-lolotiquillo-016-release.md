###Bajoneando.com###

If you have checked my code in [github](https://github.com/lnramirez) you'd know by now that my packages are named **com.bajoneando**. Also one of my early entries on the blog was about the [meaning of Bajoneando](http://lnramirez.cloudfoundry.com/blog/4f7f4cf4269873031146eecd/Bajoneando+meaning). 

Anyways, about a year ago I decided to start coding just for fun, to show off a little what I can do and to have a place to share my anecdotes and sorrows. That being said this is a **cloudfoundry** hosted site which I don't know how much longer is going to last (read between lines for free), so at some point if it ever comes with a charge I would like it to be under my fairly new and fresh domain [www.Bajoneando.com](http://www.bajoneando.com).

As of today it's only redirecting to [lnramirez.cloudfoundry.com](http://lnramirez.cloudfoundry.com) which is pretty good to me. I didn't want anybody stealing that awesome domain.

###CSS###

On wednesday I changed the look and feel of the site, nothing fancy just a new header and a navigation menu with it. I must say that I am no designer and nor interested on that field for a living but it's good to get your hands dirty and start trial and error CSS, that's my CSS way. Hope you find at least a little bit more appealing than the old way. Also there's no more home link, now link reads Bajoneando in order to align with the new domain. 

###Lolotiquillo and the process###

After [Jucuapa](http://lnramirez.cloudfoundry.com/blog/50188e462d95d47dae8311ef/From+Intipuca+to+Jucuapa) iteration I could not find a salvadorean province that started with K letter so I decided bump next letter and go with Lolotiquillo a.k.a. version 0.1.6. I still have not come back to a two week sprint plus release but as long as new good features are being added I'm happy. 

Next iteration: **Masahuat**

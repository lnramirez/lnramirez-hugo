I have not been programming lately, I got a new job -same company though- and things have been I will not say that rough, but it's been more demanding and also I am trying new schedule at work. Hopefully I will come back programming a little bit more during this week. 

Iteration Las Flores has not seen any action but I'll try to change that.
